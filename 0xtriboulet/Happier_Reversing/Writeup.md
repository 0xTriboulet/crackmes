We open the program in a console and we’re presented with the challenge:

And if we enter the wrong key we get an error!

Lets open the program in a debugger and see if we learn anything. I’m going to use x64dbg.

We can probably expect to find the key sometime after the “Enter the secret key:” string is referenced, so it might be a good idea to search for that.

And if we look around memory we see that the string we want is nearby!
“Your key was correct!”

Looking at the strings around this we see an interesting set of strings here:

Lets set some break points and see if we find anything interesting. After some careful stepping we find an interesting string generated by the binary set run time (it starts with "Keks")

We test that string on our binary and find that it works!
